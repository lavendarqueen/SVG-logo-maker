# SVG-logo-maker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
A GitHub profile with consistently high-quality README files is sure to help you stand out among the crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub, so make sure you give these important files the time and attention they deserve.

User Story
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

Mock-Up
The following image shows a mock-up of the generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: SVG for the text, white for the text color, circle from the list of shapes, and green for the shape color. Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:

Image showing a green circle with white text that reads "SVG.".
Getting Started
This Challenge combines many of the skills covered so far. In addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, we‚Äôve provided some guidelines to help you get started.

Because this Challenge requires a video submission, refer to the Full-Stack Blog video submission guideLinks to an external site. for guidance on creating and sharing a video.

Your application should use JestLinks to an external site. for running the unit tests and InquirerLinks to an external site. for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

node index.js
It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

.  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/ // Example svg file(s) created with the app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/ // Folder for classes or functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shapes.js // Exports `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shapes.test.js // Jest tests for shapes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ more... // Additional files and tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore // Indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js // Runs the application using imports from lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md // App description, link to video, setup and usage instructions  
IMPORTANT
Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.

The application must include Triangle, Circle, and Square classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the Triangle, Circle, and Square classes in a parent Shape class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

Each shape class should be tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

The following example test should pass:

const shape = new Triangle();
shape.setColor("blue");
expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');
You may need to add additional files in the lib folder for handling user input, writing to a file, etc. Writing tests for these additional files is optional.
